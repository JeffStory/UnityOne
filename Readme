This is a launcher applet that allows you to place files into your ubuntu one folder on your computer, by dragging and dropping them onto the launcher icon.

To use, Drag the file that says "UnityOne.desktop" onto your unity launcher.

Be sure to extract the zip into your home folder.

Double click the "icon installer" if you want to get the custom icon, you must have this folder in your home folder to get the icon! 
enjoy! :D
